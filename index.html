        <h1>Why join a flying club?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Accessibility</b></li>
          <p>
            While flight schools excel at training new pilots, the accessibility
            of aircraft can become challenging once you obtain your license.
            Renting an airplane often comes with limitations, as availability is
            primarily reserved for students undergoing training. However,
            joining a flying club eliminates this hassle. By simply scheduling
            your flight, the airplane becomes readily available for you to
            enjoy. Experience the freedom of having easy access to aircraft as a
            member of our flying club, ensuring you can fully embrace your
            passion for flying without unnecessary obstacles.
          </p>
          <li><strong>Affordability</strong></li>
          <p>
            Joining our flying club provides an affordable way to experience the
            joys of aviation. As a member, you can enjoy access to our
            well-maintained Cessna 152 at a fraction of the cost of individual
            ownership or renting. By sharing expenses among our club members, we
            make flying more accessible and budget-friendly. Take to the skies,
            enhance your skills, and connect with fellow aviation enthusiasts,
            all while keeping your expenses in check.
